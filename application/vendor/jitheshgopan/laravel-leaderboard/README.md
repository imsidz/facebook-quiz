# Laravel Leaderboard

## Intro

This package offers to reward entities with points and to create a ranking based on these points.

It is possible to reward, penalize, multiply, redeem and reset points and entities can be blacklisted/whitelisted which makes it possible to prevent certain entities to receive points.

Each entity will receive a rank based on its points which could be used to display a listing of the users with the most points or something like that.

## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```js
"require": {
    "jitheshgopan/laravel-leaderboard": "~1.0"
}
```

And then include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    'Jitheshgopan\Leaderboard\LeaderboardServiceProvider'
];
```

At last you need to publish the migration and run the migration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish && php artisan migrate
```

## Example

```php
$user = App\User::find(1);

$events = [
    'CompletedProfile'      => 10,
    'SocialLoginFacebook'   => 5,
    'SocialLoginTwitter'    => 5,
    'SocialLoginGoogleplus' => 5,
];

// User filled out address, phone, email, etc.
if($user->completedProfile()) {
    $user->reward($events['CompletedProfile']);
}

// User added his Facebook profile
if($user->hasSocialProfile('facebook')) {
    $user->reward($events['SocialLoginFacebook']);
}

// User removed his Facebook profile
if($user->removedSocialProfile('facebook')) {
    $user->penalize($events['SocialLoginFacebook']);
}

// User purchased a premium package
$plan = App\Plan::findByTitle('Premium');

if($user->purchased($plan)) {
    $user->reward($plan->points);
}

// User wants to purchase something
$product = App\Product::find(1);

try {
    if($user->redeem($product->price)) {
        event(new ProductWasPurchased($product, $user));
    }
} catch(\Jitheshgopan\Leaderboard\Exceptions\InsufficientFundsException $e) {
    // Not enough points
    dd($e);
}
```
